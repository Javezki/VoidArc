# VoidArc

## The Lore Purpose

The plugin was designed to server as adding more content to a custom server I'm running such as custom items that give vanilla potion effects
as well as a creating a new type of workstation called "research table". All items are meant to server toward the lore of a **Zombie Apocalypse** 
for example damage reduction for hostile mobs on armours. 

## My Thoughts

Don't use this plugin for anything beyond wanting to fix the code. This stuff is unorganized as hell and you may notice different styles of coding 
throughout the code. This is because I was learning new organization techniques and gradually integrated it into the plugin

The hardest to look at in my opinion, is the Teleport Bow folder. Don't go in there unless you want to bleach your eyes out later because its a 
mess of a folder.

## Further Developments?

Possibly. Again, this is just an intro to Minecraft Plugin Development for me and is really a lot of fun. So if anyone ever bothers reading this drop me a friend request on Discord: Javezki#0691 and shoot me some ideas
